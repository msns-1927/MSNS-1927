## My Projects 🥵 :
- **Career Advisor AI ChatBot 💼 :**
  - **Designed and developed a production-ready AI Career Advisor chatbot using Python, Streamlit, and Google Gemini API**, implementing advanced prompt engineering to generate structured JSON-based career guidance including skills, certifications, learning roadmaps, and step-by-step action plans, with multi-turn conversation memory for contextual interactions.
  - **Engineered a robust backend architecture with clean modular design**, integrating AI-based guardrail classification for responsible query filtering, structured response validation, retry mechanisms for API resilience, token usage tracking for cost monitoring, secure environment variable management, and comprehensive logging for observability.
  - **Built an interactive Streamlit chat interface and successfully deployed the application on AWS EC2**, configuring security groups, virtual environments, public access endpoints, and cloud-based environment management to deliver a fully functional, scalable, and publicly accessible GenAI system.

- **Flipkart Sentiment Analysis | End to End ML Project :**
  - Built and deployed an end-to-end sentiment analysis system to classify Flipkart product reviews as positive or negative using NLP and machine learning.
  - Preprocessed real-world review text and applied TF-IDF vectorization, training and evaluating multiple models to select the best one based on F1-score.
  - Developed a Streamlit web application and deployed it on AWS EC2 to enable real-time sentiment prediction.[https://github.com/msns-1927/flipkart_sentiment_analysis_app]
- **Multi-Label Toxic Comment Detection :**
  - This project implements a multi-label toxic comment classification system using classical Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The goal is to automatically identify different types of toxic behavior in online comments, where a single comment may belong to multiple categories such as toxic, obscene, insult, threat, severe toxic, and identity hate.
  - The workflow includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and text vectorization using TF-IDF with unigrams and bigrams. A One-Vs-Rest Logistic Regression model is trained to handle the multi-label nature of the problem. Since the dataset is highly imbalanced, the model is evaluated using F1-score and ROC-AUC metrics rather than accuracy to ensure reliable performance assessment.
  - This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline for text classification, with a focus on interpretability, proper evaluation, and best practices in handling real-world NLP data. [https://github.com/msns-1927/Multi-Label-Toxic-Comment-Detection]
- **TelcoVision : AI-Powered Market Churn Prediction System :**
  - Developed a machine learning system to predict telecom subscriber churn across India (2009–2025). Used XGBoost, LightGBM, and Ensemble models with circle-wise and operator-wise data for accurate forecasting.Built an interactive dashboard for real-time churn monitoring, risk segmentation, and business impact insights.Delivered a production-ready solution supporting data-driven retention and revenue optimization strategies.

- **YouTube Video Downloader :**
  - Developed a Python desktop application with Tkinter enabling easy YouTube video/audio downloads in multiple formats. Integrated yt-dlp and ffmpeg for efficient downloads, audio extraction, and conversion. Designed a simple interface with folder selection, error handling, and progress feedback, making content downloading accessible without command-line complexity.
